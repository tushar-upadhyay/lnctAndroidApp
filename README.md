With the Backend support of my Python based Attendance fetching app , I made android app in react native</br>
<b>Features of this App:</b> </br>
1 . We will notify students exactly at 7: A.M. with their attendance. For this I are using Firebase from Google<br/>
2 . No need to Login Again and Again, Login once and you just need to open the app to get your attendance</br>
3 . No need to Update the App as the App will  automatically download OTA (over the air) Updates
